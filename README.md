# 🧠 DSA Practice (C++)

## 🚀 Overview
This repository contains my learning and practice of **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** using **C++**.  
Each topic is organized into folders for clarity and easy navigation.

---

## 📂 Folder Structure
| Topic | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| 🔸 Arrays | Basic array operations, searching, and manipulation |
| 🔸 Sorting | Implementation of sorting algorithms (Bubble, Selection, Insertion, etc.) |
| 🔸 Recursion | Recursive logic and problem-solving patterns |
| 🔸 Basic Math | Mathematical logic problems like GCD, Prime Check, etc. |
| 🔸 Coming Soon | Trees, Graphs, and Dynamic Programming |
