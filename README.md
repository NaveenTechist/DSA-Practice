📚 Data Structures & Algorithms – Practice Repository

Welcome! I’m Naveen Yarramsetti, a dedicated B.Tech IT student and budding MERN-Stack Developer. This repository captures my journey through the world of DSA — where I transformed from a beginner into someone building real logic, solving problems and refining my code craft.

🛠 Why this repo exists
In my learning-path I realised: theoretical knowledge is good, but applying it on actual problems is what builds competence. So I created this repo to:
Practice core algorithms, data structures, recursion, sorting, arrays, basic math problems
Track my daily coding habit and consistent progress
Build clarity around logic, complexity, edge cases, and how to structure solutions
Serve as a reference portfolio for recruiters, collaborators and myself

✅ What you’ll find here
Category	Description
Arrays	Solutions covering array manipulations, search, maximum/minimum, prefix/suffix logic
Basic Math Problems	Problems involving digits, factorials, primes, combinatorics
Recursion	Recursive patterns: backtracking, divide & conquer, tree-style logic
Sorting	Various sorting techniques implemented (selection, insertion, merge, quick…)
… and more	This is a growing list — expect Graphs, Trees, DP, Advanced Topics soon

🧑‍💻 Technologies & Tools
Language: C++ (100% of this repo)
Version control: Git & GitHub
IDE/Editor: VS Code + Extensions
Practices: Clean code, meaningful comments, readability, edge-case handling

🎯 My Learning Outcomes
Strengthened ability to break big problems into smaller chunks
Gained fluency with time & space complexity analysis
Built confidence in solving algorithmic problems under constraints
Developed a lifelong habit of daily practice and consistency

📈 My Track Record
Maintained a coding streak of 690+ days, demonstrating discipline & commitment
Completed 75%+ of courses like “Build Your Own Dynamic Web Application”, “JavaScript Essentials”, “React JS – Getting Started” (as part of my growth path)
Built and shared full-stack web projects (links in my portfolio) to complement core DSA learning

🔍 How to Use This Repo
Browse folders by topic (Arrays, Recursion, Sorting…)
Inspect the solution file, read through comments & logic
Adapt the approach when you face similar problems
